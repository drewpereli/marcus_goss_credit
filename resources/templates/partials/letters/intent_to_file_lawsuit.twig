			Please be advised I have requested "validation" {not verification} of an item reported

			to you by the above original creditor/collection agency. I have received no response from

			them and/or no proof to validate their claim.
		</div>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			They have broken the law by their non response within the time period allowed by law. I

			am proceeding with legal action as prescribed by law against the above named original

			creditor/collection agency. Should this item not be deleted within the required time

			allowed by law I will seek every legal remedy available to me and file suit against the

			credit bureau responsible for reporting this erroneous claim.
		</div>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			I urge you to take this extremely seriously as I have documented my case without

			error. I encourage a response from you expeditiously.
