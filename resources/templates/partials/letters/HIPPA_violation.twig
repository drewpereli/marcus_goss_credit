			Please be advised I have requested "validation" {not verification} of an item reported
			to you by the above original creditor/collection agency. I have received a response that
			clearly violates my rights according to HIPPA.
		</div>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			{{ collection_agency_name }} did NOT provide me a HIPPA release that releases my

			medical information to them, therefore by providing such information they are in

			VIOLATION of my HIPPA rights. I am proceeding with legal action as prescribed by

			law against the above named original collection_agency/collection agency should this item not be

			deleted within the required time allowed by law. I will seek every legal remedy

			available to me and file suit against the credit bureau responsible for reporting this

			violation.
		</div>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			I urge you to take this extremely seriously as I have documented my case without

			error. I encourage a response from you expeditiously.
