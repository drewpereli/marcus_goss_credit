			To Whom It May Concern:
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
			This letter is being sent to you in response to notices sent to me from your company and

			more importantly, due to your erroneous reporting to the Credit Bureau{s}, the highly

			negative impact on my personal credit report. Please be advised that this is not a refusal

			to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC

			1692g Sec. 809 {b} that your claim is disputed and validation is requested.
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
			This is NOT a request for "verification" or proof of my mailing address, but a request for

			VALIDATION made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully

			request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal

			obligation to pay you.
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
			Please provide me with the following:
				<ul>
					<li>What the money you say I owe is for:</li>

					<li>Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe:</li>

					<li> Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I

					owe:</li>

					<li> Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable:</li>

					<li> Identify the original creditor:</li>

					<li> Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account:</li>

					<li> Show me the you are licensed to collect in my state:</li>

					<li> Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent or Agent of Service:</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
			At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated

			information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus {Experian, Equifax or TransUnion}

			this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if

			any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company

			that you represent, I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following:
			<ul>
			<li> Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act</li>

			<li> Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</li>

			<li> Defamation of Character</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
			If your offices are able to provide proper documentation as requested in the following

			Declaration, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during

			such time all collection activity must cease and desist.
			</div>

			<div class="text-right">Page 2 of 2</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
			Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered

			detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit.

			This includes listing any information with a credit reporting repository that could be

			inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate, when it fact there is no

			provided proof that it is accurate.
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
			If your company fails to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the

			date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely

			removed from my credit report and a copy of such deletion {to any/all of the 3 major

			credit reporting bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion} request shall be sent to

			me immediately.
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
			I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your

			company to my home or my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone

			communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls and

			calls or correspondence sent to or with any third parties, it will be considered

			harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with

			me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter by USPS.
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
			It would be advisable that you assure your records are in order before I am forced to

			take legal action against your company and your client. This is an attempt to correct

			your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.
